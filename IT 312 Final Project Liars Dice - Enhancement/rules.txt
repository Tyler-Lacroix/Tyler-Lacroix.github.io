Liar's Dice is a multiplayer dice game with a minimum of two players and no upper limit on the number
of participants. The goal is to make a correct guess or correctly call another player a liar.

The first player calls out two numbers: first, how many dice on the table they think have
been rolled as a number. For example, player one could say "two fives,"
which means they think there are at least two dice that are fives among all the players'
dice (including their own).

At this point, the next player can accept what has been called out and move on
or call player one out, which will end the round and result in a winner or loser for the
round.

If player one calls out "two fives," it does not matter whether player one has a five or not as
bluffing is allowed, and encouraged. It only matters if another player believes player one is bluffing
and calls them out on it. In that instance, all dice must be revealed. If player one is correct,
then they win. If player one is wrong, then the player who called them out is the winner.

If player one's call is accepted, then player two calls out a number. The first number must be
greater than what player one called. For example, if player one called out "two fives," player
two must call out three or higher for their first number, so "three fives," "three fours," or
four twos" would all be acceptable. "One five" or "two sixes" would be unacceptable.

Gameplay continues until someone is called out.
