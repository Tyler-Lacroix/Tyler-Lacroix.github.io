For my first artifact, I chose to use the final project from CS330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. This project required us to take an OpenGL renderer we spent the majority of the term updating and developing in minor parts, and using it to recreate a scene of our choice.

## Artifact 2: Algorithms & Data Structure

As a result..., I had to change gears and recreate a much simpler game if I still wanted to meet the course deadline. ...The entire program was rather
