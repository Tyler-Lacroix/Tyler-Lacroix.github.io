For my first artifact, I chose to use the final project from CS330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. This project required us to take a pre-existing and unfinished OpenGL renderer that we spent the majority of the term updating and developing in minor parts, and using it to recreate a scene of our choice. 
I chose to recreate a scene of my bedroom wall, which contained 3 shelves, 2 posters, and various personal items such as figures, video games, etc.

## Artifact 2: Algorithms & Data Structure

> The artifact is a recreation of the real world dice game, Liar’s Dice, created in C++. It was my final project for class IT312.

> I selected this item because it was a bit of a disaster project. Originally, I was going to recreate Farkle..., but I struggled over the entire duration of the term making the program work. As a result..., I had to change gears and recreate a much simpler game if I still wanted to meet the course deadline. ...The entire program was rather
> rushed and featured a lot of poorly commented/documented code and used far too many hardcoded and arbitrary values in its math.

My second artifact is an original program where I recreated a physical dice game using Visual Studio. As stated in the narrative exerpt, the original project had to be shelved pretty late in the term, and restarted with a much simpler idea. Liars Dice is a dice game where players take turns guessing how many dice of a specific value are on the board, 
with the game ending if a player is successfully called out as a liar. The original build of the program focused entirely on recreating the gameplay loop of the dice game as closely as possible. The original intent wasn't to create a modular or updatable program, simple one that works. When enhancing the artifact, I took the time to change a lot
of the math and functions in the game, in order to make the code more modular. To take advantage of this, I added two different game modes to allow players to play with 3, 5, or 10 dice instead of forcing a 5 dice game.
